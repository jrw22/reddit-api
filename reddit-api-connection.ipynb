    "* Inspect the Data: Look at a few examples where this inconsistency occurs. This manual inspection can provide insights into why this might be happening.\n",
    "* Consider Using a Threshold: Instead of relying solely on the compound score's raw value, consider setting a threshold. For instance, only interpret scores below -0.5 as indicative of strong negative sentiment. This can help reduce sensitivity to small variations in score.\n",
    "* Combine Metrics for Decision Making: If you're making decisions based on the sentiment, consider using both the sent_val and the compound score. For example, only consider a comment as strongly negative if both the sent_val is \"negative\" and the compound score is below a certain threshold.\n",
    "* Model Calibration: If the inconsistencies are frequent and problematic, you might want to consider calibrating the model on your specific data or even fine-tuning it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, when interpreting sentiment analysis results, it's crucial to understand that metrics can sometimes provide different perspectives, and each has its strengths and weaknesses. Considering them in tandem and in the context of your specific application will help in achieving more accurate and meaningful interpretations."
